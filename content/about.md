Me
---


I am Xuesong Ye (叶雪松).

Currently, I work at LinkedIn on ML Infrastructure, embracing the wave of AI.
My focus is on distributed systems, model training, and inference — work that I find both exciting and meaningful.

This blog is mainly a place to share my learning notes, system design thoughts, and personal reflections, with the post on life outside of work.
